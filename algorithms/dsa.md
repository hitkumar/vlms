# Data structures and algorithms

Complement this with solving problems

Lectures notes

Lecture 1
- Introduces the concept of an algorithm and complexity analysis of Algorithms
- Pigeon hole principle.

Lecture 2
- API vs data structure
- API is an interface, data structure deals with how to store data
- Word size and address space are related.
- Static sequences can be thought of as an array, although Python doesn't have this.
- Static sequences vs LinkedList vs Dynamic array discussion.
- Python List is an example of dynamic array.

Lecture 3
- Sets and sorting
- Set interface
  - build(A)
  - len()
  - find(k)
  - insert(x)
  - delete(k)
  - findMax()
  - findMin()
- Sorting algorithms
  - Permutation sort (O(n.n!))
  - Selection sort (O(n^2))
  - Insertion sort (O(n^2))
  - Merge sort (O(n.log(n)))
